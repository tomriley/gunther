**Note:** Gunther hasn't been under development for a few years now and I'd recommend that people find and use some other CMS for new projects (Magnolia looks good for Java users, Radiant for Rails users). But I still occasionally receive emails from people asking about Gunther or wanting to take over the project so I've moved Gunther from SourceForge to the wonderful Github where people are free to fork there own versions!
